            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <!-- <img src="" alt="Jessie Shockey web developer"> PROFILE PICTURE WILL GO HERE!!-->
            <p>My name is Jessie Shockey and I am a full stack web developer. I come from a background in the Behavioral Health, Mental Health, and Substance Abuse as a Billing 
                and Collections Specialist.<br>During my career I also worked as a Software Support Specialist for an Electronic Health Record platform, 
                where I found that developers often lacked the nuanced knowledge of commercial and government insurance billing requirements. This lack of knowledge led to 
                gaps within the software's functionality to facilitate a more streamlined billing experience for agencies.
                <br>My professional goal is to help bridge that functional gap between agencies and their Revenue Cycle Managment software, to create more flexible billing process
                which accommodates the ever changing billing requirements that agnecies face.
